## Instructions:

Create a Git repository for this test and put each theme in a separate branch.
Use PHP as the primary language.
Follow best programming practices, including good naming and code organization.
Ensure that each challenge has a separate PHP file in the repository.

Here are the challenges for the test:

### 1. Theme: Logic (Branch: logic-test)

a. check if a number is prime:
    Write a PHP program that takes a number as input and determines whether it is prime or not. The program should display a message indicating whether the number is prime or not.
b. Check if a word is a palindrome:
    Write a PHP program that takes a word as input and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards). The program should display a message indicating whether the word is a palindrome or not.
c. Check if a year is a leap year:
    Write a PHP program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not. The program should display a message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.


### 2. Theme: Arrays (Branch: arrays-test)

a. Find the largest number in an array:
    Write a PHP program that finds and displays the largest number in an array of numbers.
b. Find the longest name in an array:
    Write a PHP program that finds and displays the longest name in an array of names.
c. Calculate the sum of elements in an array:
    Write a PHP program that calculates and displays the sum of all elements in an array of numbers.


### 3. Theme: Loop Structures (Branch: loop-structure-test)

a. Display numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order:
    Write a PHP program that displays numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.
b. Display the multiplication table of a user-chosen number:
    Write a PHP program that prompts the user for a number and displays the multiplication table of that number from 1 to 10.
c. Display even numbers from 1 to 20:
    Write a PHP program that displays even numbers from 1 to 20.


### 4. Theme: Object-Oriented Programming (Branch: object-oriented-programming-test)

a. Create a PHP class called "Person" with the following attributes:
    firstName (for storing the person's first name);
    lastName (for storing the person's last name);
    dob (for storing the person's date of birth as a string in the format
    "YYYY-MM-DD");
b. Implement a constructor in the class to initialize these attributes when a new object is created.
c. Add a function getAge() to the class that calculates the person's age based on their date of birth and returns it. You can use PHP's built-in date functions to calculate the age accurately.
d. Create an object of the "Person" class, set the first name, last name, and date of birth attributes, and then use the getAge() function to display the person's age.


### 5. SQL Questions:

a. SQL Query to Retrieve Names:
    Write an SQL query to retrieve the first names and last names of all persons in a hypothetical "persons" table. Display the results.
b. SQL Query to Remove Minors:
    Write an SQL query to remove all records from the "persons" table for individuals who are minors (under 18 years old) based on their date of birth.
c. SQL Query with JOIN (persons and children):
    Suppose you have two tables: "persons" and "children," where "persons" contains information about adults, and "children" contains information about their children. Write an SQL query that retrieves the first and last names of adults from the "persons" table along with the names of their children from the "children" table. Use a JOIN operation to combine the two tables.
